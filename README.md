# ðŸŽ¨ Amena Miri - Personal Portfolio Website

## ðŸŒŸ Theme & Inspiration

This project is a personal portfolio site showcasing my work as a graphic designer and front-end developer. The visual theme is inspired by modern glassmorphism UI combined with a minimalist layout and vibrant Afghan cultural visuals.

## ðŸ§  Key Features

- Responsive multi-section layout (Home, About, Skills, Portfolio, Contact)
- Glassmorphism effect with CSS blur and transparency
- Smooth hover effects and animated gradient titles
- Creative display of real and imaginary projects
- Pure HTML and CSS only â€“ no JavaScript used
- Contact form (dummy action for now)
- Mobile-first layout using CSS Grid and Flexbox

## ðŸŽ¨ Design Decisions

- Fonts:  
  - Titles: Playfair Display  
  - Body: Poppins  
  This combination gives a modern yet elegant look.

- Color Palette:  
  - Primary: #ff4d6d  
  - Secondary: #ff8fa3  
  A vibrant, energetic pink palette to reflect creativity and visual energy.

- Visuals:  
  - Portfolio includes personal graphic design work such as posters, brochures, and digital illustrations (e.g., Herat Citadel).
  - Used images and original artwork to enrich visual storytelling.

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Google Fonts
- Font Awesome (for icons)
- Git + GitHub Pages for hosting

## ðŸ“± Responsiveness

Although no media queries are used, the layout adapts well to screen sizes by:
- Using flexbox, grid, auto-fit, and minmax()
- Applying relative units like %, em, and vw/vh
- Ensuring all images and sections scale fluidly

ðŸ‘‰ For perfect mobile optimization, media queries would still be recommended in future versions.

## ðŸš§ Challenges Faced

- Building responsiveness without JavaScript or media queries was challenging.
- Designing visual hierarchy purely with layout and CSS effects.
- Creating an engaging layout using only CSS and HTML (no templates used).
